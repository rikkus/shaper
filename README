Shaper version 0.1

*** Use at own risk. May delete all your files, blow up your computer...  ***

Per-process traffic shaper.
Nasty, nasty, nasty hack.

Basic instructions:

Install with 'make install' and rehash your shell.

Now run a program which uses TCP sockets and notice that it is limited
to 1kB/s input. Or it should be. If it's not, that's because this is
a major hack and it probably doesn't work with some programs.

You can set some things with environment variables.

* SHAPER_DEBUG_LEVEL

  A number from 0 to 3, where 0 is no output.

  Default: 0

* SHAPER_READ_LIMIT

  Max bytes to read per second.

  Default: 1024

* SHAPER_INTERVAL

  Delay between 'cycles' in microseconds.
  Less means your app doesn't stall so long, but the limiting gets less
  exact and it could eat CPU with really low values. Stick with the default
  if you know what's good for you.

  Default: 100000
